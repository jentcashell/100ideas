1. In the book, Boulton mentioned the CBBS and the WELL as examples of BBSs. Other early examples of BBS are: ISCABBS (the largest international BBS at the University of Iowa, still operating), OSUNY (legendary 80s hacker/phreaker BBS), GLIB (Gay and Lesbian Information Bureau, information and services for gay and lesbian community in the 80s, 90s),etc.(1) 
To access the BBS, we can use Telnet Client, an internet application available in most modern operating system (2). 

2. Geocities was saved by Archive Team, now being operated by Jason Scott and a group of volunteers, who functioned as Warriors, Writers, People with Lots of Hosted Disk Space, People who love setting up torrents,and OCD-rich individuals who want to download things.(3)
Their archiving method involves downloading a gigantic amount of data from GeoCities pages at a rate of 1GB/30min through all of the teamâ€™s different vectors. In 48 hours, they saved 200,000 GeoCites sites.(4)
