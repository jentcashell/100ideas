**Definition of the Internet:**
The internet is a system of computer networks operating globally, connecting devices with the TCP/IP (internet protocol suite). It carries a variety of information, including hypertext documents, emails, telephony, and the World Wide Web.

**Historical context:**

The Web
In 1934, Paul Otler foresaw the idea of the Web: “A machinery unaffected by distance which would combine at the same time radio, X-rays, cinema and microscopic photography.”, in hopes that the Mundaneum could overcome the limitation of physical paper records.

In Dream Machine released in 1974, Harvard scholar Theodore Ted Nelson wrote about the Xanadu, a vision of creating an information space where text is liberated from paper, and he coined the term “hypertext”, predicting the personal computer revolution. This changed the understanding of our usage of the computer. 

The Internet
The internet was founded as a side product of the Space Race. Joseph Licklider of the ARPA established the Intergalactic Computer Network, and Paul Batam designed a communication system that is strong enough to survive a nuclear attack. The combination of these two projects led to the invention of the Internet. Later, a US government communication system ARPANET was established. The transmission process is breaking down the message, send them through multiple paths, and reassemble at the destination. On October 29 1969, the first message was first sent through the ARPANET, the word “Log”, even though the system crashed when they reached the G. 
At the beginning of the 70s, more packet-switching networks were created, so Robert Kahn came up with this idea of joining them together by establishing a common set of rules called “Internet Protocol Suite” (TCP/IP). This enabled the appearance of Internet service providers and bulletin board systems. 


The Wifi
In 1977, Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington built the first PC modem. At the turn of the century, broadband technology combined routers, network switches, Wifi, and modems were combined into one device. 
Hedy Lamarr, an actress of Hollywood glamour, came up with an idea of the Wifi in 1940, which is a radio signal which changes its frequencies continuously in able to transmit sign from the source to the receiver. In 1971, a computer network at the University of Hawaii was formed based on the technology that Hedy invented, which was the first wireless network. The term Wifi is latter coined in 1999 by Interbrand.
