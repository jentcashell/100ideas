5 digital ideas for my research:

1. 3D Printing Organs

3D printing organs is a bioengineer technology that use 3D bioprinter to manufacture artificial organs. In 2019, a team of scientist at Rice University in Texas developed a 3D bioprinter which successfully printed a lung structure that simulate blood flow. Printing organs is considered a solution to the shortage of donor organ. Technique to print organs is drop-based bio printing which builds up a structure by utilizing droplets of assigned material, along with extrusion bioprinting. The materials used for bio printing are alginate or fibrin, and the cell can be sourced from the patents themselves to produce new organs, which limits the risks of transplant rejection.

2. Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality is an interactive experience in which reality is augmented with projections of information. Notable examples of augmented reality are the game Pokemon Go and Instagram/Snapchat lenses. AR technology operate on phone and tablets or any other devices that allow pointing a camera pointing to the front, and in near future, AR can be implemented in the form of glasses/contact lenses. AR has been used since the 1990s as fighter aircraft display to show information like altitude, direction, velocity of the plane. This technology opens door to many application in many fields such as gaming, shopping (trying on clothing virtually), doing art (Instagram filters).

3. Self Driving car

Self-driving car or autonomous vehicle are vehicle which can sense its surrounding and drive without (much) human operation. Self-driving car are connected with sensors such as  radar, liar, sonar, GPS, odometer, and inertial measurement units. Back in 1984, Ernst Dickmanns first created an autonomous van, and by 2013, many car manufacturers started developing self-driving cars. This technology raises concerns regarding human safety and unemployment problem.

4. Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are robots built in shape of human bodies, some operates with artificial intelligence algorithm, serving many functions such as research for human prothesis, performing human tasks (elderly assisting, cooking, cleaning, driving, or even teaching), and do dangerous jobs. As artificial intelligence is developing exponentially, humanoid robots raises many ethical concern since they are predicted to become more intelligent than human and learn emotion and consciousness which make them human.

5. Instagram

Instagram is an online photo and video sharing social networking platform which allows user to take pictures and short videos and apply filters on them and share them to the followers. The interface is minimalistic and simple, attracting 1 billion users as of May 2019.Created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram was released in October 6, 2010 and initially allowed 1:1 photo/video posting (resembling polaroid picture) but now extended to 4:3 ratio. In competition to Snapchat, Instagram added Insta Story which last 24 hours which is used by 500 million users daily. Instagram is criticized for censorship, policy changes, and illegal content uploaded by users.
