1. According to Roach on Urban Dictionary, “flame war” means “A heavy discussion on wordforums/word that usually ends in total chaos.” To my understanding, when people heatedly contribute into a discussion online, there will be a flame war. 

In Smiley Lore, Scott E. Fahlman himself put, “Given the nature of the community, a good many of the posts were humorous (or attempted humor).  The problem was that if someone made a sarcastic remark, a few readers would fail to get the joke, and each of them would post a lengthy diatribe in  response.  That would stir up more people with more responses, and soon the original thread of the discussion was buried. […] Various “joke markers”  were suggested, and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution“ (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm)
To sum up, the emoticons that Scott E. Fahlman invented are used as markers for jokes, the :-); or serious issues, the :-(, which augment in online communication, helping people interpret each other words easier.

2. The emoticons means emotion icons, invented by Scott E Fahlman in 1982, composed of computer character, and the original versions involve reading them sideways. Meanwhile, emojis are invented by Japanese in the 90s, used for the cellphone only, and no one have to tilt their head to the side to read them. Emojis are pictograms or graphic icons, and they do not just exist in the form of smiley face but also objects, weather, animals, etc. Example of early emoji can be found in the font Wingdings in Microsoft platforms. 

3. “Lossy” compression means that the JPEG format compresses file quality to reduce file size, only show a part of data compared to the original image. Some other types of image file compression are: 
(1) RAW (no compression, good for editing photos); 
(2) PNG (Lossless compression, suitable for putting online, editing, storage, can have transparency); 
(3) GIF (Lossless compression, multiple frames animation, small size); 
(4) TIFF (both lossy and lossless, good for documents, scanning,etc).

4. Other than in the image file, text file, or web page, metadata can be found in:
(1) an email (contains subjects, from, to, time sent, format); 
(2) a blog article (contains title, author, date of publication, category, tags); 
(3) an art piece in the museum (contains Title, artist, date, medium, dimension).
