Draw a map of connections between the ideas/technologies expressed in the chapters above. This map should show the relationships between the various ideas (the different types of "mouses", TCP/IP, Hypertext, the Web, Browsers, Servers, etc.), who influenced who, what came before what else, etc. You can draw it however you'd like (photoshop, pencil, etc.) so long as you push an image file to your homework repo.
